  <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

  <p>
    I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page
    on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
  </p>

  <p>
    This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
    back and see how my journey is going!
  </p>

  {happy && "Today I am happy!"}
  {finished && "I AM DONE WITH THE TUTORIAL!"}
  {goal === 3 ? <p>I want to finish in 3 days</p> : "Not 3 days"}

  <h3>Here are a few facts about me:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>My name is {identity.firstName}</li>
    <li>
      I live in {identity.country} and my occupation is {identity.occupation}
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Some skills</h3>
  <ul>
    {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
  </ul>
